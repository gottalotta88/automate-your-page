        B tag is for bold
      </p>
      <p>
        em tag is for italics
      </p>  
      <p>  
        If you don't close tag; everything after is bolded/italicized
      </p>  
      <p>
        a is for anchor
         <ul>
          <li>Used for making links</li>
          <li>Followed by an attribute name, value, and then contents
          </ul>
        img is for image
          <ul>
          <li>Src and alt are attributes; alt is what to display if broken request
          <li>Img doesn't have any content, so no closing tag; this is called a void tag, a tag that has no content</li>
          </ul>
        Lines
          <ul>
          <li>br is a line break to make text go onto next line; also a void tag</li>
          <li>p is for paragraph; need closing tag after content</li>
          <li>Br just puts to next line whereas p tag makes an invisible box; br is an inline element while p is a block element; latter creates blocks on the screen</li>
          <li>Spaces and returns will not be registered</li>
          </ul>
        Span and div
          <ul>
          <li>Span can be used to give CSS styles to contents; inline element</li>
          <li>Div does the same but as a block element</li>
          </ul>
        Thus basic HTML vocab consists of <b>tags</b>, <b>elements</b>, and <b>attributes</b>

        Can highlight the HTML code in the developer tools DOM corresponding to an object and then adjust the style details for it
        <ul>
          <li>http://assignments.udacity-extras.appspot.com/courses/html-css/samples/shapes.html</li>
          <li>Unchecking border radius box turns circles into squares; all elements of a document are actually boxes</li>
          <li>When given a design mock, you "boxify" it into boxed components</li>
          <li>Can split up a box with nested divs</li>

    <div class="text">
      <p>
        Allows style and appearance formatting; for example can make all h1 elements of the class "x" look the same way
      </p>
      <p>
        One key benefit of using CSS for styling is <b>repetition</b>; allows you to write far less styling code which can be abstracted as classes and summoned with short snippets of code
      </p>
      <p>
        Repetition also makes a page run faster

      <p>h1 is a <b>selector</b>; rule can be applied to all h1; can also apply rule to all div</p>
      <p>color:red is a <b>declaration</b></p>
      <p>color is a <b>property</b>; red is the value of that property</p>

    <div class="header2">Clarifications</div>
    <div class="text">
        Span vs. Div
        <ul>
          <li>Div is block element; good for grouping and organization</li>
          <li>Span class can be used as inline element; example in class code of using it for span class=italic and then defining italic in CSS</li>
        </ul>
        Id vs class
        <ul>
          <li>Id uniquely identifies an element and don't repeat, as opposed to class which can be repeated</li>
          <li>Useful if want to use <b>anchor element to link to a particular spot</b>; id="welcome"; a href="#welcome"</li>
          <li>Class better for grouping similarly</li>
          <li>Can use both id and class in a div</li>
        </ul>

  <div class ="subtopic">
    <div class ="header2">Box model</div>
    <div class="text">
      <p>
        All HTML elements are boxes
      </p>
        Components
        <ul>
          <li>Content -  text and images</li>
          <li>Padding - transparent area</li>
          <li>Border - border around padding and content</li>
          <li>Margin; transparent; basically whitespace between boxes</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Width of content as defined won't be total width; total width of box involves adding content, padding, and border
      </p>
      <p>
        Not intuitive to have defined width not reflect what is actually rendered; thus <b>box-sizing</b> property with <b>border-box</b> value will make defined width the width of the combo of border, padding, and content which is more intuitive; margin not included in size
      <p>
        Can set width as percentage of window so that it adjusts to window width
      </p>
      <p>
        Max-width attribute such that will adjust but not above a max width; overrides width property

        Indexing refers to retrieving a value of a particular character in a string
      </p>
      <p>
        s[0] gives first letter of string named s; ditto for subsequent numbers; if s[3] and string only 3 characters, will return error; s[0] can cause error for empty string; subsequence operator does not return error for this issue
      </p>
      <p>
        s[-1] gives last letter
      </p>
      <p>
        Can also do "example"[0] which will result in e, where string is defined in the expression
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequences can be extracted with expression like s[0:2] which will represent first 2 letters; starts at the first number, ends before the second number
      </p>
      <p>
        Can also do s[:2] which will give first 2 characters; key is doesn"t include the number you border with; can do s[2:] which goes to end
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like with lists, can use in/not to index and return boolean value for whether substring is within a string; print "hello" in y returns True is string y contains hello

  <div class="subtopic">
    <div class="header2">Lists</div>
    <div class = "text">
      <p>
        Lists contain multiple ordered elements which can include numbers, strings, or other lists
      </p>
      <p>
        When assigning list, enclose in brackets; tuples are enclosed in parentheses
      </p>
      <p>
        Can have nested lists where every element in a list is another list; this is great for storing items when have items that have attributes like name and birthdate or country and capital
      </p>
      <p>
        Mutation refers to the ability to change individual elements within lists by assigning new values to them
      </p>
      <p>
        Strings are not mutable whereas lists are; numbers are also not mutable since they are not objects
      </p>
      <p>
        If assign a list p to a different variable q, now both variables refer to the same list object; if you mutate p, q will experience that mutation since both pointing to the same object
      </p>
      <p>
        Having two different ways to refer to the same object is called aliasing

      <p>
        Append: <list>.append(<string>) will add string to the list; can also append with a new list; this appended element will then refer to the list and respond to any changes in this list object to which it refers
      </p>
      <p>
        Addition: <list> + <list>; key distinction between append and add is that former adds new item as a list item
      </p>
      <p>
        Length: len(<list>) gives length of the list; this also works for strings to get number of characters
      </p>
      <p>
        Index: <list>.index(<value>) will return location; if not present, get error; you wrote a longer way to do this in the exercise;
      </p>
      <p>
        In/Not in: <value> in <list>; output boolean answer to whether true or false; can also do <value> not in <list> to give the opposite boolean value; when using in if statement, don"t need any additional operators since returns boolean; "if x in p"

        "For x in y" has the function walk along the list y and then you can do whatever you want to each element x; if there are nested lists, can manipulate them within function using list operations

        First step is to understand the problem: problem is defined by inputs and outputs; how do you get from the input to the output?

        Next work out some examples to understand the relationship
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider systematically how a human solves the problem

      <p>
        Simple mechanical solution; don"t optimize prematurely
      </p>
      <p>
        Emphasizes writing small bits of code and methodically testing each small bit along the way so you make systematic progress; avoids major bugs at the end
